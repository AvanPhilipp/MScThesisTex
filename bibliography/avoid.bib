abstract="A real-time vision system with multiple cameras was developed for UAV collision warning and visual navigation for fixed-wing small- or medium-sized aircrafts. The embedded vision system simultaneously acquires images using five cameras, stores, and evaluates the visual data with an FPGA-based multi-core processor system. The system was designed to fulfill the strict size, power, and weight requirements arising from UAV on-board restrictions. The hardware parameters of the system and the performance of the algorithm are compared to the state of the art.",

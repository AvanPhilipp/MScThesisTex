abstract = "Two border following algorithms are proposed for the topological analysis of digitized binary images. The first one determines the surroundness relations among the borders of a binary image. Since the outer borders and the hole borders have a one-to-one correspondence to the connected components of 1-pixels and to the holes, respectively, the proposed algorithm yields a representation of a binary image, from which one can extract some sort of features without reconstructing the image. The second algorithm, which is a modified version of the first, follows only the outermost borders (i.e., the outer borders which are not surrounded by holes). These algorithms can be effectively used in component counting, shrinking, and topological structural analysis of binary images, when a sequential digital computer is used."
